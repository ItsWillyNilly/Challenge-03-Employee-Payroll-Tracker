# Challenge-03-Employee-Payroll-Tracker
This is an employee payroll tracker created using HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

## Description
I was tasked with adding code to existing code. Specifically, I needed to create 3 functions for collecting employee data like first and last names and salary, another for displaying the average salary in the console, and finally a function for selecting a random employee and displaying them in the dev tool.

## User Story

```
AS A payroll manager
I WANT AN employee payroll tracker
SO THAT I can see my employees' payroll data and properly budget for the company
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN an employee payroll tracker
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue
THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data
